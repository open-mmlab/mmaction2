## Abstract

<!-- [ABSTRACT] -->

Temporal action proposal generation is an challenging and promising task which aims to locate temporal regions in real-world videos where action or event may occur. Current bottom-up proposal generation methods can generate proposals with precise boundary, but cannot efficiently generate adequately reliable confidence scores for retrieving proposals. To address these difficulties, we introduce the Boundary-Matching (BM) mechanism to evaluate confidence scores of densely distributed proposals, which denote a proposal as a matching pair of starting and ending boundaries and combine all densely distributed BM pairs into the BM confidence map. Based on BM mechanism, we propose an effective, efficient and end-to-end proposal generation method, named Boundary-Matching Network (BMN), which generates proposals with precise temporal boundaries as well as reliable confidence scores simultaneously. The two-branches of BMN are jointly trained in an unified framework. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3, where BMN shows significant performance improvement with remarkable efficiency and generalizability. Further, combining with existing action classifier, BMN can achieve state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance.

:::{note}

1. The **gpus** indicates the number of gpu we used to get the checkpoint.
   According to the [Linear Scaling Rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677), you may set the learning rate proportional to the batch size if you use different GPUs or videos per GPU,
   e.g., lr=0.01 for 4 GPUs x 2 video/gpu and lr=0.08 for 16 GPUs x 4 video/gpu.
2. For feature column, cuhk_mean_100 denotes the widely used cuhk activitynet feature extracted by [anet2016-cuhk](https://github.com/yjxiong/anet2016-cuhk).
3. We evaluate the action detection performance of BMN, using  [anet_cuhk_2017](https://download.openmmlab.com/mmaction/localization/cuhk_anet17_pred.json) submission for ActivityNet2017 Untrimmed Video Classification Track to assign label for each action proposal.

:::

\*We train BMN with the [official repo](https://github.com/JJBOY/BMN-Boundary-Matching-Network), evaluate its proposal generation and action detection performance with [anet_cuhk_2017](https://download.openmmlab.com/mmaction/localization/cuhk_anet17_pred.json) for label assigning.
