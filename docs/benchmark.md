# Benchmark

We compare our results with some popular frameworks and official releases in terms of speed.

## Comparision Rules

Here we compare our MMAction2 repo with other video understanding toolboxes in the same data and model settings
by the training time per iteration. Here, we use
- commit id [7f3490d](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction/tree/7f3490d3db6a67fe7b87bfef238b757403b670e3)(1/5/2020) of MMAction
- commit id [8d53d6f](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/temporal-shift-module/tree/8d53d6fda40bea2f1b37a6095279c4b454d672bd)(5/5/2020) of Temporal-Shift-Module
- commit id [8299c98](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast/tree/8299c9862f83a067fa7114ce98120ae1568a83ec)(7/7/2020) of PySlowFast
- commit id [f13707f](https://github.com/wzmsltw/BSN-boundary-sensitive-network/tree/f13707fbc362486e93178c39f9c4d398afe2cb2f)(12/12/2018) of BSN(boundary sensitive network)
- commit id [45d0514](https://github.com/JJBOY/BMN-Boundary-Matching-Network/tree/45d05146822b85ca672b65f3d030509583d0135a)(17/10/2019) of BMN(boundary matching network)

To ensure the fairness of the comparison, the comparison experiments were conducted under the same hardware environment and using the same dataset. The rawframe dataset we used is generated by the [data preparation tools](/tools/data/kinetics400/preparing_kinetics400.md), the video dataset we used is a special version of resized video cache, featuring a faster decoding speed which is generated by the scripts [here]().

For each model setting, we kept the same data preprocessing methods to make sure the same feature input.
In addition, we also used MemCache, a distributed cached system, to load the data for the same IO time except for fair comparisons with Pyslowfast which uses raw videos directly from disk by default.

The time we measured is the average training time for an iteration, including data processing and model training.
The training speed is measure with s/iter. The lower, the better. We provide the training log based on which we calculate the average iter time, with the actual setting logged inside, feel free to verify it and fire an issue if something does not make sense.
