## Installation

- **"No module named 'mmcv.ops'"; "No module named 'mmcv._ext'"**

    1. Uninstall existing mmcv in the environment using `pip uninstall mmcv`.
    2. Install mmcv-full following the [installation instruction](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation).

- **"OSError: MoviePy Error: creation of None failed because of the following error"**

    Refer to [install.md](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/master/docs/install.md#requirements)
    1. For Windows users, [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) will not be automatically detected by MoviePy,
    there is a need to modify `moviepy/config_defaults.py` file by providing the path to the ImageMagick binary called `magick`,
    like `IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY = "C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick_VERSION\\magick.exe"`
    2. For Linux users, there is a need to modify the `/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml` file by commenting out
    `<policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*" />` to `<!-- <policy domain="path" rights="none" pattern="@*" /> -->`,
    if ImageMagick is not detected by moviepy.

## Data

- **FileNotFound like `No such file or directory: xxx/xxx/img_00300.jpg`**

    In our repo, we set `start_index=1` as default value for rawframe dataset, and `start_index=0` as default value for video dataset.
    If users encounter FileNotFound error for the first or last frame of the data, there is a need to check the files begin with offset 0 or 1,
    that is `xxx_00000.jpg` or `xxx_00001.jpg`, and then change the `start_index` value of data pipeline in configs.


## Training

- **How to just use trained recognizer models for backbone pre-training ?**

    Refer to [Use Pre-Trained Model](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/master/docs/tutorials/finetune.md#use-pre-trained-model),
    in order to use the pre-trained model for the whole network, the new config adds the link of pre-trained models in the `load_from`.

    And to use backbone for pre-training, you can change `pretrained` value in the backbone dict of config files to the checkpoint path / url.
    When training, the unexpected keys will be ignored.


## Testing

- **How to make predicted score normalized by softmax within [0, 1] ?**

    change this in the config, make `test_cfg = dict(average_clips='prob')`.
