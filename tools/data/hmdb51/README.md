```

For basic dataset information, you can refer to the dataset [website](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/).
Before we start, please make sure that the directory is located at `$MMACTION2/tools/data/hmdb51/`.

To run the bash scripts below, you need to install `unrar`. you can install it by `sudo apt-get install unrar`,
or refer to [this repo](https://github.com/innerlee/setup) by following the usage and taking [`zzunrar.sh`](https://github.com/innerlee/setup/blob/master/zzunrar.sh)
script for easy installation without sudo.

## Step 1. Prepare Annotations

First of all, you can run the following script to prepare annotations.

```shell
bash download_annotations.sh
```

## Step 2. Prepare Videos

Then, you can run the following script to prepare videos.

```shell
bash download_videos.sh
```

## Step 3. Extract RGB and Flow

This part is **optional** if you only want to use the video loader.

Before extracting, please refer to [install.md](/docs/install.md) for installing [denseflow](https://github.com/open-mmlab/denseflow).

If you have plenty of SSD space, then we recommend extracting frames there for better I/O performance.

You can run the following script to soft link SSD.

```shell
# execute these two line (Assume the SSD is mounted at "/mnt/SSD/")
mkdir /mnt/SSD/hmdb51_extracted/
ln -s /mnt/SSD/hmdb51_extracted/ ../../../data/hmdb51/rawframes
```

If you only want to play with RGB frames (since extracting optical flow can be time-consuming), consider running the following script to extract **RGB-only** frames using denseflow.

```shell
bash extract_rgb_frames.sh
```

If you didn't install denseflow, you can still extract RGB frames using OpenCV by the following script, but it will keep the original size of the images.

```shell
bash extract_rgb_frames_opencv.sh
```

If both are required, run the following script to extract frames using "tvl1" algorithm.

```shell
bash extract_frames.sh
```

## Step 4. Generate File List

you can run the follow script to generate file list in the format of rawframes and videos.

```shell
bash generate_rawframes_filelist.sh
bash generate_videos_filelist.sh
```

## Step 5. Check Directory Structure

After the whole data process for HMDB51 preparation,
you will get the rawframes (RGB + Flow), videos and annotation files for HMDB51.

In the context of the whole project (for HMDB51 only), the folder structure will look like:
