```

For basic dataset information, please refer to the official [website](https://research.google.com/ava/index.html).
Before we start, please make sure that the directory is located at `$MMACTION2/tools/data/ava/`.

## Step 1. Prepare Annotations

First of all, you can run the following script to prepare annotations.

```shell
bash download_annotations.sh
```

This command will download `ava_v2.1.zip` for AVA `v2.1` annotation. If you need the AVA `v2.2` annotation, you can try the following script.

```shell
VERSION=2.2 bash download_annotations.sh
```

## Step 2. Prepare Videos

Then, use the following script to prepare videos. The codes are adapted from the [official crawler](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/ava-dataset).
Note that this might take a long time.

```shell
bash download_videos.sh
```

Or you can use the following command to downloading AVA videos in parallel using a python script.

```shell
bash download_videos_parallel.sh
```

Note that if you happen to have sudoer or have [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) on your machine,
you can speed up the procedure by downloading in parallel.

```shell
# sudo apt-get install parallel
bash download_videos_gnu_parallel.sh
```

## Step 3. Cut Videos

Cut each video from its 15th to 30th minute and make them at 30 fps.

```shell
bash cut_videos.sh
```

## Step 4. Extract RGB and Flow

Before extracting, please refer to [install.md](/docs/en/install.md) for installing [denseflow](https://github.com/open-mmlab/denseflow).

If you have plenty of SSD space, then we recommend extracting frames there for better I/O performance. And you can run the following script to soft link the extracted frames.

```shell
# execute these two line (Assume the SSD is mounted at "/mnt/SSD/")
mkdir /mnt/SSD/ava_extracted/
ln -s /mnt/SSD/ava_extracted/ ../data/ava/rawframes/
```

If you only want to play with RGB frames (since extracting optical flow can be time-consuming), consider running the following script to extract **RGB-only** frames using denseflow.

```shell
bash extract_rgb_frames.sh
```

If you didn't install denseflow, you can still extract RGB frames using ffmpeg by the following script.

```shell
bash extract_rgb_frames_ffmpeg.sh
```

If both are required, run the following script to extract frames.

```shell
bash extract_frames.sh
```

## Step 5. Fetch Proposal Files

The scripts are adapted from FAIR's [Long-Term Feature Banks](https://github.com/facebookresearch/video-long-term-feature-banks).

Run the following scripts to fetch the pre-computed proposal list.

```shell
bash fetch_ava_proposals.sh
```

## Step 6. Folder Structure

After the whole data pipeline for AVA preparation.
you can get the rawframes (RGB + Flow), videos and annotation files for AVA.

In the context of the whole project (for AVA only), the *minimal* folder structure will look like:
(*minimal* means that some data are not necessary: for example, you may want to evaluate AVA using the original video format.)
