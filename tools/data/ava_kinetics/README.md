For basic dataset information, please refer to the official [website](https://research.google.com/ava/index.html).
AVA-Kinetics dataset is a crossover between the AVA Actions and Kinetics datasets. You may want to first prepare the AVA datasets. In this file, we provide commands to prepare the Kinetics part and merge the two parts together.

For model training, we will keep reading from raw frames for the AVA part, but read from videos using `decord` for the Kinetics part to accelerate training.

Before we start, please make sure that the directory is located at `$MMACTION2/tools/data/ava_kinetics/`.

## Step 1. Prepare the Kinetics700 dataset

The Kinetics part of the AVA-Kinetics dataset are sampled from the Kinetics-700 dataset.

It is best if you have prepared the Kinetics-700 dataset (only videos required) following
[Preparing Kinetics](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/master/tools/data/kinetics). We will also have alternative method to prepare these videos if you do not have enough storage (coming soon).

We will need the videos of this dataset (`$MMACTION2/data/kinetics700/videos_train`) and the videos file list (`$MMACTION2/data/kinetics700/kinetics700_train_list_videos.txt`), which is generated by [Step 4 in Preparing Kinetics](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/master/tools/data/kinetics#step-4-generate-file-list)

The format of the file list should be:

```
Path_to_video_1 label_1\n
Path_to_video_2 label_2\n
...
Path_to_video_n label_n\n
```

The timestamp (start and end of the video) must be contained. For example:

```
class602/o3lCwWyyc_s_000012_000022.mp4 602\n
```

It means that this video clip is the 12th to 22nd seconds of the original video. It is okay if some videos are missing, and we will ignore them in the next steps.

## Step 2. Download Annotations

Download the annotation tar file (recall that the directory should be located at `$MMACTION2/tools/data/ava_kinetics/`).

```shell
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Datasets/ava_kinetics_v1_0.tar.gz
tar xf ava_kinetics_v1_0.tar.gz && rm ava_kinetics_v1_0.tar.gz
```

You should have the `ava_kinetics_v1_0` folder at `$MMACTION2/tools/data/ava_kinetics/`.

## Step 3. Cut Videos

Use `cut_kinetics.py` to find the desired videos from the Kinetics-700 dataset and trim them to contain only annotated clips. Currently we only use the train set of the Kinetics part to improve training. Validation on the Kinetics part will come soon.

Here is the script:

```shell
python3 cut_kinetics.py --avakinetics_anotation=$AVAKINETICS_ANOTATION \
                        --kinetics_list=$KINETICS_LIST \
                        --avakinetics_root=$AVAKINETICS_ROOT \
                        [--num_workers=$NUM_WORKERS ]
```

Arguments:

- `avakinetics_anotation`: the directory to ava-kinetics anotations. Defaults to `./ava_kinetics_v1_0`.
- `kinetics_list`: the path to the videos file list as mentioned in Step 1. If you have prepared the Kinetics700 dataset following `mmaction2`, it should be `$MMACTION2/data/kinetics700/kinetics700_train_list_videos.txt`.
- `avakinetics_root`: the directory to save the trimmed ava-kinetics videos. Defaults to `$MMACTION2/data/ava_kinetics`.
- `num_workers`: number of workers used to cut videos. Defaults to -1 and use all available cpus.

There should be about 100k videos. It is OK if some videos are missing and we will ignore them in the next steps.

## Step 4. Extract RGB Frames

This step is similar to Step 4 in [Preparing AVA](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/dev-1.x/tools/data/ava#step-4-extract-rgb-and-flow).

If you have installed denseflow. You can refer to [Preparing AVA](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/dev-1.x/tools/data/ava#step-4-extract-rgb-and-flow). to extract RGB frames. Here we provide a script to extract RGB frames using ffmpeg:

```shell
python3 extract_rgb_frames.py --avakinetics_root=$AVAKINETICS_ROOT \
                              [--num_workers=$NUM_WORKERS ]
```

Arguments:

- `avakinetics_root`: the directory to save the trimmed ava-kinetics videos. Defaults to `$MMACTION2/data/ava_kinetics`.
- `num_workers`: number of workers used to cut videos. Defaults to -1 and use all available cpus.

## Step 5. Prepare Annotations

Use `prepare_annotation.py` to prepare the training annotations. It will generate a `kinetics_train.csv` file containning the spatial-temporal annotations for the Kinetics part, localting at `$AVAKINETICS_ROOT`.

Here is the script:

```shell
python3 prepare_annotation.py --avakinetics_anotation=$AVAKINETICS_ANOTATION \
                              --avakinetics_root=$AVAKINETICS_ROOT \
                              [--num_workers=$NUM_WORKERS]
```

Arguments:

- `avakinetics_anotation`: the directory to ava-kinetics anotations. Defaults to `./ava_kinetics_v1_0`.
- `avakinetics_root`: the directory to save the trimmed ava-kinetics videos. Defaults to `$MMACTION2/data/ava_kinetics`.
- `num_workers`: number of workers used to cut videos. Defaults to -1 and use all available cpus.

## Step 4. Fetch Proposal Files

The pre-computed proposals for AVA dataset are provided by FAIR's [Long-Term Feature Banks](https://github.com/facebookresearch/video-long-term-feature-banks). For the Kinetics part, we use `Cascade R-CNN X-101-64x4d-FPN` from [mmdetection](https://download.openmmlab.com/mmdetection/v2.0/cascade_rcnn/cascade_rcnn_x101_64x4d_fpn_1x_coco/cascade_rcnn_x101_64x4d_fpn_1x_coco_20200515_075702-43ce6a30.pth) to fetch the proposals. Here is the script:

```shell
python3 fetch_proposal.py --avakinetics_root=$AVAKINETICS_ROOT \
                          --datalist=$DATALIST \
                          --picklepath=$PICKLEPATH \
                          [--config=$CONFIG ] \
                          [--checkpoint=$CHECKPOINT ]

```

Arguments:

- `avakinetics_root`: the directory to save the trimmed ava-kinetics videos. Defaults to `$MMACTION2/data/ava_kinetics`.
- `datalist`: path to the `kinetics_train.csv` file generated at Step 3.
- `picklepath`: path to save the extracted proposal pickle file.
- `config`: the config file for the human detection model. Defaults to `X-101-64x4d-FPN.py`.
- `checkpoint`: the checkpoint for the human detection model. Defaults to the `mmdetection` pretraining checkpoint.

## Step 5. Merge AVA and Kinetics
