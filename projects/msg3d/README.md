[Disentangling and Unifying Graph Convolutions for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14111)

<!-- [ALGORITHM] -->

## Abstract

<!-- [ABSTRACT] -->

Spatial-temporal graphs have been widely used by skeleton-based action recognition algorithms to model human action dynamics. To capture robust movement patterns from these graphs, long-range and multi-scale context aggregation and spatial-temporal dependency modeling are critical aspects of a powerful feature extractor. However, existing methods have limitations in achieving (1) unbiased long-range joint relationship modeling under multi-scale operators and (2) unobstructed cross-spacetime information flow for capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies. In this work, we present (1) a simple method to disentangle multi-scale graph convolutions and (2) a unified spatial-temporal graph convolutional operator named G3D. The proposed multi-scale aggregation scheme disentangles the importance of nodes in different neighborhoods for effective long-range modeling. The proposed G3D module leverages dense cross-spacetime edges as skip connections for direct information propagation across the spatial-temporal graph. By coupling these proposals, we develop a powerful feature extractor named MS-G3D based on which our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and Kinetics Skeleton 400.

## Usage

### Setup Environment

Please refer to [Get Started](https://mmaction2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html) to install MMAction2.

At first, add the current folder to `PYTHONPATH`, so that Python can find your code. Run command in the current directory to add it.

> Please run it every time after you opened a new shell.

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
```

### Data Preparation

Prepare the NTU60 dataset according to the [instruction](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/1.x/tools/data/skeleton/README.md).
